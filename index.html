                <p>David Michael Draiman (born March 13, 1973)
                    is an American singer and songwriter.
                    Noted for his distorted, operatic, baritone voice and
                    percussive singing style, he is best known as the lead
                    vocalist of the heavy metal band Disturbed since 1996.
                    He has written some of the band's most successful singles,
                    such as "Stupify", "Down with the Sickness", "Indestructible",
                    and "Inside the Fire". In 2006, he was ranked at No. 42
                    on the Hit Parader list of "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time".
                    During Disturbed's hiatus from 2011 to 2015, he worked
                    on an industrial metal project with Geno Lenardo, which
                    was later named Device. They released one self-titled
                    album in 2013. Disturbed returned with the album
                    Immortalized in 2015 and Evolution in 2018.</p>
